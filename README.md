# Python Data Structure

Making an introduction to data structures using Python to start solving LeetCode problems.

## Introduction

To understand data structures and algorithms, we must know the three basic pillars:

1. **How the information is arranged in the memory of the computer.**
2. **Become familiar with the algorithms for manipulating the information contained in the data structure.**
3. **Understand the performance characteristics of the data structure** so that when called upon to select a suitable data structure for a particular application, you can make an appropriate decision.

## Object-Oriented Design

The traditional approaches to software design have been either data-oriented or process-oriented.

- **Data-Oriented:** Emphasizes the representation of information and the relationships between the parts of the whole (the actions which operate on the data are of less significance).
- **Process-Oriented:** Emphasizes the actions performed by a software artifact (the data are of lesser importance).

Now, it's commonly held that **object-oriented methodologies** are more effective for managing the complexity that arises in the design of large and complex software artifacts. This is because data and processes are given equal importance. Objects are used to combine data with procedures that operate on that data. Using objects provides **abstraction** and **encapsulation**.

- **Abstraction:** Can be thought of as a mechanism for suppressing irrelevant details while emphasizing relevant ones.
  - **Example:** Procedural abstraction lets the software designer think about the actions to be performed without worrying about how those actions are implemented.
  
- **Encapsulation:** Aids the software designer by enforcing information hiding. In a sense, the object hides the details of the implementation from the user of that object.
